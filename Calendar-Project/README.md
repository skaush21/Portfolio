## Description

This project implements an event calendar in which users can create, edit, and delete events that will show up on the selected calendar view on the main 
index page. The user can select from daily, weekly, monthly (default view), and yearly views. Users will be able to create an account, access their own calendar, view the scheduled events for the day/week/month, and search for their scheduled events by name. They will also be able to create/update/delete event details as needed. Users can also send invites to other users which will allow the latter to copy events to their own calendar.
